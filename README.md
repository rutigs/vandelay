VandelayIndustries
==================
VandelayIndustries is a web application made by students (their first) that parsed a public dataset from the city of Vancouver containing information on Cultural Spaces. 

Our requirements were the following:
- parse a public dataset and persist the data on the server (Google App Engine)
- let the user login using a 3rd party api to access the application (Google)
- present the data informatically and geographically (not shown in this iteration)
- allow the users to save favourites (completed but with duplication bugs)

The project was done in Java with Google Web Toolkit, hosted on Google App Engine.

Project Retrospective
=====================
In hindsight the entry point class (Vandelyv2.java) is full of spaghetti code and anti-patterns. Way too many imports and not enough refactoring due to time constraints. I (Rutigs) felt like this was not an easy framework/language combo to learn web development in due to the nature of the stack. 
Working in an AGILE environment for the first time however was very nice. I enjoyed having incremental goals with sprints and tasks all cleanly laid out for me as it was always clear what I could be working on and what I would be doing next.
